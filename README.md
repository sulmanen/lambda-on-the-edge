# lambda-on-the-edge
What is Lambda@Edge and what can I do with it

# Why?
I wrote some Lambda@Edge code which got thrown away and now I can tell you this story.

# Write up about AWS Lambda@Edge

# What
- run code close to the viewer at cloudfront edge locations

# It's not AWS Lamda

# Supported environments
- node
- python


# Set up private amazon account

# Deploy lamdas

# Typescript typings

# Test typescript typings

# Examples



# Things to remember
- origin responses can only mutate headers, not the url or the body of the request
- just because your test works, don't assume lamba@edge runs the way your test does
